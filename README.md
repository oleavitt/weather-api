# Weather API app

## Overview
An iOS weather app developed using SwiftUI that displays current weather and forecasts for a given location or place. It uses the "weatherapi.com" RESTful API as its data source. Any active alerts for the region will be shown.

### Requirements
- iOS 17.6 or later
- [![xcode-version](https://img.shields.io/badge/xcode-16.2-brightgreen)](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) ![ios-version](https://img.shields.io/badge/iOS-17.6-lightBlue)

- SwiftUI and SwiftData
- An API key from WeatherAPI.com

#### WeatherAPI.com
You can sign up for a free or paid account at https://www.weatherapi.com
This will give you the API key needed to use the Weather API app.
When you have your key, set the API key in the app's Settings -> API Providers screen.

 ### Usage
- Launch the app. You will see a message asking you to setup the API key.
- Grant Location usage permissions if you see the system prompt for that.
- Set the API key in Settings -> API Providers
- Return back to Settings screen and tap "Here & Now" or "Forecast" to view weather for your location.
- Enter a city name, zip code or three letter airport code in the search bar at top to view weather elsewhere.
- Tap the blue location button (below search, at the right of "Last updated") to get weather for your current location.
- Navigate to the History tab to view a history of previous weather queries.
- Navigate to the Settings tab to set display units preferences, delete old history, or update the API key.
