# Weather API app

An iOS weather app built around the "weatherapi.com" API.

To build the app you will need to create an account (free or paid) at "weatherapi.com".
You will receive an API key that needs to be included as a parameter in all API requests.
When you have your key, set the API_KEY define in the Xcode project to your key value. This will
attach your API key to all requests.
